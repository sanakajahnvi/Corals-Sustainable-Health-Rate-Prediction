# Corals Health Prediction 

This project predicts the health of coral reefs using environmental data and machine learning. It is aimed at supporting marine conservation efforts by providing early insights into coral degradation risks.

#Project Overview

Coral reefs are essential marine ecosystems, but they're under threat due to climate change and pollution. This project uses data such as temperature, species richness, and coral density to train a machine learning model that predicts whether coral health is likely to improve or decline.

# Features

- Predict coral reef health status (healthy/unhealthy)
- Web interface built using Flask
- Dynamic visualizations with HTML, CSS, JS
- Easy-to-use prediction form for user inputs
- Supports ecological trend monitoring

# Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Scikit-learn** (for model training)
- **Flask** (backend web framework)
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** (frontend UI)
- **Pandas, Seaborn** (data handling & visualization)

# How It Works

1. Environmental datasets are preprocessed and merged.
2. A classification model (e.g., Random Forest) is trained on labeled data.
3. The web app takes inputs like year, temperature, and species richness.
4. The trained model predicts coral health and displays results.
